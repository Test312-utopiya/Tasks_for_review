# Getting Started
This is the recommended path for getting started with AI/ML. But you can always choose your own path. Please read 
the [instructions](#instructions-) carefully.

## Instructions üìù
* You can always choose your own path. Order is specifically for people who
  are new to computer science and programming.
* If you have experience in python programming, you can skip the [python](#1-python-) part and start with the 
  [ML Stack](#2-ml-stack-) or [Courses](#3-courses-).
* You can always skip the optional parts.
* You can always choose your own resources, projects, and datasets.
* You can always ask for help in the [Discord Server](https://discord.com/channels/1086178685385719868/1145305120280674354).
* After completing the [python](#1-python-) part, you can start working on the [projects](#4-hands-on-prep-).
  You can always learn the [ML Stack](#2-ml-stack-) and [Courses](#3-courses-) while working on the projects.

## 1. Python üêç
Learn Python! It's the most popular language for AI/ML. You can learn it in a few days. You can also learn it while 
learning AI/ML. But it's better to learn it first.

* [Codecademy - Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)
* [FreeCodeAcademy 4h Beginner Course](https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw)
* [FreeCodeAcademy 6h Intermediate Python Programming Course](https://youtu.be/HGOBQPFzWKo)
* **Optional**: [Python Cookbook](./Books/Python%20Cookbook.pdf)
* **Optional**: [Python Data Science Handbook](./Books/Python%20Data%20Science%20Handbook.pdf)

You can download the books by clicking on the download icon in the top right corner of the content box.

After having a good understanding of Python, try out these questions from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/):
- [The minion game](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-minion-game/problem?isFullScreen=true)
- [ginorts](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ginorts/problem?isFullScreen=true)
- [Bot saves princess](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/saveprincess?isFullScreen=true&hr_b=1)
- [Bot saves princess 2](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/saveprincess2?isFullScreen=true&hr_b=1)
- [Bot clean](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/botclean?isFullScreen=true&hr_b=1)

You can use resources like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) for 
help. But don't copy-paste code. Try to understand it and write it yourself.

## 2. ML Stack üòú
Here come some of the most popular libraries for AI/ML. 

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Here is a [NumPy Tutorial](https://youtu.be/9JUAPgtkKpI).
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - A fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. Here is a [Pandas Tutorial](https://youtu.be/vmEHCJofslg).
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Here is a [Matplotlib Tutorial](https://youtu.be/3Xc3CA655Y4).
* **Optional**: [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - A free software machine learning library for the 
  Python 
  programming language. Here is a [Scikit-learn Tutorial](https://youtu.be/0B5eIE_1vpU).<br>
* **Optional**: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - An end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. 
  Here is a [TensorFlow Tutorial](https://youtu.be/tPYj3fFJGjk).<br>
* **Optional**: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - An open source machine learning framework that accelerates the 
  path from research prototyping to production deployment. Here is a [PyTorch Tutorial](https://youtu.be/EMXfZB8FVUA).<br>

## 3. Courses ü§ñ
Now you are ready to learn AI/ML! Here are some resources to get you started.
* [Kaggle Intro to ML](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
* [Kaggle Intermediate ML](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)
* **Optional**: [Machine Learning Specialization Andrew Ng | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) (Three Courses)

You can always continue with the rest of the courses in Kaggle and Coursera. But you can also start doing some 
projects at the same time while you are learning.

## 4. Hands-on prep üöÄ
Here are some of the datasets you can use for your projects.
* Beginner: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
* Beginner: [Iris Species Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)
* Intermediate: [Prima Indians Diabetes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
* Intermediate: [Amazon Reviews Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews)
* Advanced: [MNIST Handwritten Digits](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist)
* Advanced: [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

You can use [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) for your projects. It's free and easy to use. You can also use 
[Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks).<br>
