# App development Tasks:

# Framework: Flutter and Dart

Why flutter?
 Flutter is a cross-platform mobile development framework that allows you to build native-like apps for iOS and Android from a single codebase. It is also possible to use Flutter to build web apps and desktop apps.

What are widgets?
 In Flutter, a widget is a building block for your user interface. It is a description of what a part of your UI should look like and how it should behave. Widgets are arranged in a tree-like structure, with each widget having one or more children. The root widget of the tree is the entire UI of your app.
